		<p> Now, this is a story all about how
		My life got flipped-turned upside down
		And I'd like to take a minute	
		Just sit right there I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel Air

		In West Des Moines, Iowa born and raised
		On the playground was where I spent most of my days
		Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool
		And all shootin some b-ball outside of the school
		When a couple of guys who were up to no good
		Started making trouble in my neighborhood
		I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
		She said 'You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel Air.

		I whistled for a cab and when it came near
		The license plate said "Fresh" and it had dice in the mirror
		If anything I could say that this cab was rare
		But I thought, "Nah, forget it."
		â€“ "Yo, home to Bel-Air."

		I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8
		And I yelled to the cabbie, "Yo home smell ya later."
		I looked at my kingdom
		I was finally there
		To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel-Air
